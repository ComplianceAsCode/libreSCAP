# Coming Soon
Forking from Red Hat's legacy [OpenSCAP](https://github.com/openscap/openscap) scanner, libreSCAP is intended to become a community driven, modern, cloud native SCAP scanner. Written in golang, libreSCAP will feature an API-first workflow into performing SCAP scans and parsing results.
